#Things coming future updates

###Armor system:

this mean the default health removed will be 2 instead of 1.
But if you have armor the health will be 1 so therefore you will take less damage
will could also make having armor more useful by adding a extra 10 health this will mean will have to alter the health system

###Health System (making it possible to die):

By adding the armor system we will have to add more options for future levels so therefore it will be possible to die in game

###Making it all on page instead of pop-ups 

Please note for the mobile phone this will not apply because it's simply to much extra work to style the mobile verison so don't expect much (or we could forget this)

Anyway for those people that play the game on computer we will create a gui for you guy's so the good news will be there will be 0 pop-ups

###Creating a score system and a global leaderboard 

We are thinking we could easily add this the points (as of now) will probaly be based on how many levels you completed

###Final note:
We always love to hear you feedback you can fetch my email under the social tab & the game will always be free

###Now play on!
